## Why?

I don't like the current social media options but I still want a place to share my interests online. Eventually I might have something original to say. In the meantime, I hope to get better at writing and organizing my thoughts <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/selfish-writing/" target="_blank">for my own benefit</a>.

## What to expect:

- periodic media diet/link posts
- short book reports
- tutorials for technical concepts aimed at beginners

## Will you get anything out of this blog?
